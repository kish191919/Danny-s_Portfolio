# Bike-Sharing-Demand_by_R

Predict demand on bike with ML.
This project follows the instructions of a Kaggle competition since 2014.
The link of the competition is https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand

### Data description
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

# 1. Introduction
# Load all the packages required for the analysis
library(ggplot2) # Visualisation
library(dplyr) # Data Wrangling
library(randomForest) # Randomforest model

# Read data from a file
train <- read.csv('./Data/train.csv')
test <- read.csv('./Data/test.csv')

print(colnames(train))
print(colnames(test))

cat("number of train dataset", nrow(train), "\n")
cat("number of test dataset", nrow(test), "\n")

# 2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
ggplot(train, aes(temp, count)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=temp), alpha=0.2) + theme_bw()

# This is a scatterplot of temperature versus count with a color gradient based on temperature. The plot depicts the bike rental count increases as the temperature increases.

# Let's plot a scatterplot of datetime versus count with a color gradient based on temperature. However, we need to first convert the datetime intoPOSIXct format.
train$datetime <- as.POSIXct(train$datetime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

ggplot(train, aes(datetime, count)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=temp), alpha =0.2) + 
  scale_color_gradient(high = 'blue', low='green') + theme_bw()

# It can be clearly seen the winter and summer seasonalities of the data. As seen on the previouse scatterplot, this scatterplot shows the rental counts are increasing in general.

# Explore the season data using a box plot
train$season <- factor(train$season)

ggplot(train, aes(season, count)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(color=season), alpha = 0.2) +theme_bw()

# Surprisingly, there are more rentals in winter (season 4) than in spring (season 1)

# 3. Feature Engineering
# I engineer a new feature from the datetime column.
# Let's create an hour column that takes the hour from the datetime column.
train$hour <- sapply(train$datetime, function(x) format(x, "%H"))
head(train)

# Now I create a scatterplot of hour versus count with color scale based on temperature. 
# First create the plot for the working days.
ggplot(filter(train, workingday==1), aes(hour, count)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=temp), alpha=0.5, position=position_jitter(w=1, h=0)) + 
  scale_color_gradientn(colors=c('dark blue','blue','light blue','yellow','orange','red')) +
  theme_bw()

# Now create the same plot for the non working days.
ggplot(filter(train, workingday==0), aes(hour, count)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=temp), alpha=0.2, position = position_jitter(w=1, h=0)) + 
  scale_colour_gradientn(colors = c('dark blue','blue','light blue','yellow','orange','red')) + theme_bw()

# The plots illustrate the working days have peak bike activaty during the morining and right after working (around 6pm) with some luchtime activity.
# Whereas the non-working days have a steady rise and fall for the afternoon.

# 4. Prediction
# Change the hour column to a column of numeric values.
train$hour <- sapply(train$hour, as.numeric)

# Let's check whether missing values exist.
sapply(train, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

# Extract the rows with missing values
filter(train, is.na(hour) == TRUE | hour=='')

# Remove missing data rows
train <- filter(train, is.na(hour) != TRUE)

cor(train$temp, train$atemp)

# The features temp and atemp are strongly correlated. If both features are included in the model, this will cause the issue of Multicollinearity 
# Hence I include only one temperature feature into the model.
# The features casual and registered are omitted because that is what we are going to predict.
# The feature datetime is omitted since the new feature hour is included in the model and which is more meaningful in predicting the bike rental demand

# Continue on building a model to forecast bike rental demand.

# 4.1 Prepare input data
test$datetime = as.POSIXct(test$datetime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") 
test$hour = sapply(test$datetime, function(x) format(x,"%H"))
test$hour = sapply(test$hour, as.numeric)
test$season = factor(test$season)

# 4.2 Model_1 : RandomForest
#Variables
myNtree = 1000
myMtry = 6
myImportance = TRUE

model_1_casual_fit <- randomForest(casual ~ hour + humidity + temp + atemp + workingday + windspeed, data=train, ntree=myNtree, mtry=myMtry, importance=myImportance)
model_1_casual <- predict(model_1_casual_fit, test)


model_1_registered_fit <- randomForest(registered ~ hour  + season + weather + workingday + humidity + atemp + windspeed, data=train, ntree=myNtree, mtry=myMtry, importance=myImportance)
model_1_registered <- predict(model_1_registered_fit, test)

# Add both columns into final count, round to whole number
y_pred <- round(model_2_casual + model_2_registered, 0)

# Save the results
results <- data.frame(datetime = test$datetime, count = y_pred)

# Write the results to a csv file
write.csv(results, file = './submit/submission.csv', row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)

# Kaggle Result
# Score : 0.48613
# Rank : 1,357 / 3,251 (41.7%)
